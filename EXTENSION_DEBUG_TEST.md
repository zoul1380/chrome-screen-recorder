# 🔧 Extension Debug Test Instructions

## 🚨 No Debug Messages Issue
You're not seeing any debug messages, which suggests a fundamental issue with the extension or console access.

## 🧪 Step-by-Step Debug Test

### Test 1: Check Extension Loading
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Find "WebP & GIF Page Recorder" extension

### Test 2: Popup JavaScript Test

2. Look for these visual indicators:

### Test 3: Console Access Test
1. **Right-click** on the extension popup (not the icon, but the actual popup window)
2. Select **"Inspect"** from the context menu
3. This opens DevTools for the popup
4. Go to the **Console** tab
5. You should see messages like:
   ```
   POPUP: JavaScript is loading...
   POPUP: DOMContentLoaded event fired
   POPUP: Elements found: {startBtn: true, watermarkEnabled: true, ...}
   ```

### Test 4: Simple Button Test
